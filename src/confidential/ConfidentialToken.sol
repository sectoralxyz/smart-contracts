/// @title ConfidentialToken
/// @notice The privacy primitive everything else is arranged around: a wrapper
///         that turns a plain ERC-20 such as USDG into balances nobody but their
///         owner can read. Balances and transfer amounts live as ElGamal
///         ciphertexts on the alt_bn128 curve, and a zero-knowledge proof
///         checked on-chain establishes that each transfer is sound without
///         disclosing a single value. Who paid whom stays public. How much does
///         not.
///
/// @dev The shape of it:
///      - An account registers an ElGamal public key and from then on carries
///        one ciphertext balance `(c1, c2)`.
///      - {deposit} wraps the underlying asset by folding `amount * G` into `c2`
///        with zero randomness — the ordinary Zether funding step — which leaves
///        the running balance readable to the depositor's own view key.
///      - {confidentialTransfer} accepts two ElGamal deltas, one encrypting
///        `-amount` to the sender and one encrypting `+amount` to the recipient,
///        with a proof. The verifier insists both carry the same non-negative
///        figure and that the sender remains solvent; the contract then applies
///        each delta by point addition, which is why no amount ever appears in
///        calldata or in storage.
///      - {withdraw} unwraps against a proof that the encrypted balance covers
///        the figure.
///
///      The verifier sits behind {setVerifier} precisely so the circuits can be
///      replaced without migrating balances.
